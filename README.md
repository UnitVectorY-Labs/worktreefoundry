# worktreefoundry

A schema-driven tool for managing configuration data stored in a Git repository.

`worktreefoundry` provides:
- A local web UI (`worktreefoundry web`) for browsing and editing objects in workspace branches.
- Repository validation (`worktreefoundry validate`) for layout, schema, and cross-object constraints.
- Deterministic export (`worktreefoundry export`) that compiles YAML objects into JSON artifacts.
- Repository bootstrap (`worktreefoundry init`) that initializes a sample repo with schemas and data.

See `/docs/README.md` for detailed documentation.
